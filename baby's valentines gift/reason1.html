    <h1>❤️ i feel safe with you</h1>
    <p>
    feeling safe with someone(for me) is not that easy at all but with YOU it was the easitest thing i could ever try,thank you for being YOU, don't be hard on me one day no matter what happend or will happen between us, i may sound childish or weird but this is the first thing that cross my mind when we go through bad terms, i hope i don't look selfish by saying this but deep inside me all i want is your empathy and love
    i'm sorry if i made you upset or annoyed but it was because i needed you and i missed you
    happy Valentine honey👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨❤️‍🔥
