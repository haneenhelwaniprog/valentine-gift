    <h1> YOU ARE MINE ❤️</h1>
    <p>
      From the first moment i saw you i knew you are someone and the only thing i was looking for since i was born,i'm glad because i've owned you,
    it feels like i owned the whole world,i'd rather see you dead than see you with another someone,sorry for saying that(myabe i'm not)but that is the true,
    i'll make sure that no one can take you away from me exept god,but that does not mean also you can do wrong stuf unproperly or look in lustful eyes yk what i mean,
    i know you are not a lustful man cuz that is the most disgusting thing, if one day you felt you don't want to be with me anymore come to me and tell me that right to my face
    (even tho you won't stay alive), i've never looked at another someone or talked with someone, you know that right,no man could ever full my eyes like you do,you are more than enough for me❤️
    you are my EVERYTHING i've wished for💕YOU ARE MINE and you will stay mine till we both die,i made myself a promise that you either mine nor no one's
    Happy Valentines Day MON BEBE❤️💗💖💘💝💕💞🩷
