    <h1> You are funny❤️</h1>
    <p>
      you being super eatable when you act brat or cute,wish you could've see yourself in my eyes,i still in love when you try to make me laugh when i'm upset with you or annoyed
     i appreciate everything you did,doing, and will do for us in the first place then for me❤️
     you have no idea how you make my heart feels warm and safe around you,that's the whole point,sometimes when i miss you and miss your funny side,
     i just remember every single joke you've told me the last two years,don't be upset with me when i make you mad that's bcz i miss you more than you could imagine🥺🥺💞
     i wish you won't be harsh with me someday,that could break my heart cuz it's the last thing i will expect from you,i mean yeah you did made me sleep in sorrow,didn't believe you could've say that to me,
     but yeah it could happens but not from you,anyways when you don't feel the vibe or not in the mood when i'm joking and talking with you you can tell me,
     instead of leaving me thinking why did you act like that,it's exhuasted to think over and over,you don't answear me as well when i ask you a question,
     idk what to say,we all make mistakes but when you don't let a space for discussing there is something wrong;
     ummm soooo HAPPY VALENTINES DAY ❤️‍🔥💍i just wanted to say what's in my heart and mind
     ENJJOYYY READING MY LETTERS FOR YOU MON VIE❤️💗💖💘💝💕💞🩷HOPE YOU LIKED MY GIFT🙊🥹🤭🤭
