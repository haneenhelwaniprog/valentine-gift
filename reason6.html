    <h1>You are the way YOU ARE❤️</h1>
    <p>
     i hope you don't change the way you talk,laugh,smile,wake up,reply,comfort,flirt,joking,asking,your tone,and every detail of you i'm totally obsseed with them,
      even the things you might find it cringe, i adore them and make me fall harder for you day by day,i hope i made you comfortable enough to act like yourself,without thinking i could judge you,
      avoid you, or feel like I am alienated from you, i just see as my baby, there is no mom does not love her baby, she will loves him unconditionally
      it is ok every person has flaws, we can fix them together,sometimes i even justify your flaws, because i trust you, you won't hurt me,even if you did 
      that wasn't be on purpose,you can be the way you are with yourself when you sit alone by yourself and no one hear you, when you act weak,exhuasted,
      Disgraced,disappointed,lonely and when you feel everything against you, you will find me always with you💋💋👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍❤️‍👨💗💖💖💝💘🩷💞💕
